ONLINE PAYMENT FRAUD DETECTION 

Introduction

Online payment is the most popular transaction method in the world today. However, with an increase in online payments also comes a rise in payment fraud. The objective of this notebook is to train machine learning models for identifying fraudulent and non-fraudulent payments. The dataset is collected from Kaggle, which contains historical information about fraudulent transactions which can be used to detect fraud in online payments.



The dataset consists of 10 variables:


transaction_id: number of transaction 

customer_id: unique customer id

merchant_id: unique customer id

amount: the amount of transaction

transaction_time: the time of the transaction 

is_fraudulent: fraud detection 

card_type: the type of the card 

location: location of transaction 

customer_age: the age of the customer

fraud_type: the type of fraud/theft



Python Libraries

pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, tabulate, sklearn

Random Forest and Naive Bayes were used to identify online payment fraud due to the large dataset.
